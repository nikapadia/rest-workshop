## How to run the project

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you can download both from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Clone the repository
2. Install nodemon globally by running `npm install -g nodemon`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`

You can also modify `package.json` to use `node` instead of `nodemon` if you don't want to install `nodemon` globally.
